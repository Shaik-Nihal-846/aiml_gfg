# Day 3
## 🏘 Predicting Housing Market Trends with AI

A regression model that predicts **house prices** using property attributes such as size, number of rooms, luxury level, and location.

### 🎯 Goal
Build a price prediction model and understand the factors affecting property valuation.

### 🔍 Key Findings
- Location is the strongest pricing factor.
- Waterfront / good view properties demand a significant premium.
- Home grade and interior quality heavily influence pricing.
- Large floor area doesn't always scale price linearly.

### 🛠 Workflow
1. Outlier handling + missing value treatment
2. EDA and correlation heatmap
3. Feature engineering (total area, house age, etc.)
4. Train regression models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Linear Regression)
5. Evaluate using RMSE, MAE, and R² score
