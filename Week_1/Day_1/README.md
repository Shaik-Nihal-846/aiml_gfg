## 🚢 Data Storytelling – Analysing Survival on the Titanic

This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to understand **which passenger attributes influenced survival during the disaster**, using data storytelling and exploratory data analysis.

### 🎯 Goal
Identify survival patterns using demographic and travel-related parameters.

### 🔍 Key Findings
- Females survived significantly more than males.
- First-class passengers had the highest survival rate.
- Children had better survival chances than adults.
- Higher ticket fare was linked to higher survival probability.

### 🛠 Workflow
1. Data cleaning (handling missing age and embarkation values)
2. EDA to compare survival across gender, class, and age groups
3. Visual storytelling using bar charts and distribution plots
4. Model training (Logistic Regression / Random Forest) for prediction
