# Day 5
## 🧩 Smart Segmentation – Customer Personas with AI

Unsupervised learning model to group customers into **personas** based on spending patterns, income, and behavior.

### 🎯 Goal
Help businesses tailor marketing, discounts, and loyalty strategies using segmentation.

### 🔍 Identified Personas (Example)
| Segment | Behaviour |
|--------|-----------|
| Premium Spenders | High income + high spending |
| Budget Buyers | Low income + low spending |
| Trend-Driven Youth | Young customers with high spending |
| Loyal Moderates | Steady, average spending |

### 🛠 Workflow
1. Feature scaling + preprocessing
2. Elbow method / Silhouette score → choose optimal clusters
3. K-Means clustering and PCA-based visualization
4. Persona interpretation for business strategy
