## ❤️ AI in Healthcare – Heart Disease Prediction

A machine learning model that predicts whether a patient is likely to have **heart disease** based on clinical metrics and symptoms.

### 🎯 Goal
Assist early risk screening using ML-based predictions (not a replacement for diagnosis).

### 🔍 Key Findings
- Chest pain type, ST depression, and maximum heart rate are strong indicators.
- Age and high cholesterol significantly increase risk.
- Combining exercise-induced angina and ECG irregularities strengthens prediction.

### 🛠 Workflow
1. Preprocessing + scaling clinical numerical features
2. EDA comparing healthy vs diseased groups
3. Training multiple classifiers (SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
4. Evaluation using Precision, Recall, F1-Score & ROC curve
