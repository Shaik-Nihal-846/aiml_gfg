## 📄 Intelligent Document Processing (IDP)

This project automates document understanding by extracting and structuring information from unstructured PDFs, forms, and reports using AI.

### 🎯 Objective
Convert static documents into machine-readable structured data for analytics and automation.

### 📌 Workflow
1. OCR extraction from scanned documents
2. Entity recognition for key fields (names, dates, IDs, tables)
3. Classification / routing of documents
4. Validation and error-handling pipeline
5. Export structured output to JSON / CSV

### 🔍 Key Insights
- Rule-based OCR is less reliable than AI-assisted IDP
- Combining layout + text features increases extraction accuracy
