## 🌐 Web Automation on Autopilot — Building an AI Browser Agent

This automation system performs browsing actions based on natural-language instructions, eliminating the need for manual script writing.

### 🎯 Objective
Create an agent that autonomously interacts with websites to search, click, type, extract, and navigate.

### 📌 Workflow
1. Instruction intake and NLP interpretation
2. Convert natural-language tasks to browser operations
3. Execute actions using Selenium / Playwright
4. Log collected information
5. Repeat for multi-step workflows

### 🔍 Key Insights
- LLM-based parsing supports flexibility beyond rule-based automation
