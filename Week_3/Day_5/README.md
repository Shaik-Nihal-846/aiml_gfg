## 💻 Generative AI for Software Development — The Future of Coding

An exploration of AI-assisted programming using LLMs as collaborative coding partners — generating, debugging, refactoring and documenting code.

### 🎯 Objective
Evaluate how AI can support software engineers in real-world development workflows.

### 📌 Workflow
1. Natural-language problem prompt
2. LLM-generated code solution
3. Human verification and refinement
4. Auto-documentation and test case recommendation
5. Iterative debugging through conversational coding

### 🔍 Key Insights
- AI accelerates prototyping and boilerplate generation
- Human oversight is necessary for correctness and security
