## 🌐 Web Scraping using AI Agents

An AI-driven approach to automated web data extraction that replaces traditional manual CSS/XPath selectors with LLM-powered decision-making.

### 🎯 Objective
Enable an agent to navigate websites, locate information, and extract structured data using reasoning instead of hard-coded selectors.

### 📌 Workflow
1. Browser setup (Selenium / Playwright)
2. LLM-based inspection of webpage and action planning
3. Auto-selection of target elements and scraping rules
4. Execution of extraction tasks
5. Export of scraped data to CSV

### 🔍 Key Insights
- AI agents can adapt scraping logic to new websites
- Fail-rate decreases when paired with DOM inspection tools
