## 🧠 Text2SQL via Prompt Engineering

This project demonstrates how Large Language Models can act as natural-language database interfaces by generating SQL queries from plain-English prompts.

### 🎯 Objective
Translate user questions into optimized SQL queries without manual query writing.

### 📌 Workflow
1. Connect to structured dataset (table schema awareness)
2. Collect natural-language user prompts
3. Prompt engineering to guide LLM to generate valid SQL
4. Execute generated query on the database
5. Display results and evaluate query correctness

### 🔍 Key Insights
- Schema-aware prompting improves SQL relevance
- Query sanitization is essential to avoid malformed outputs
- Text2SQL reduces the learning curve for non-technical users
