## 🖼️ Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project builds a deep learning model using **CNNs** to classify images into predefined categories.

### 🎯 Objective
Train a CNN that can accurately identify image classes based on pixel patterns and feature hierarchies.

### 📌 Workflow
1. Load and preprocess image dataset (resize, normalize, augmentation)
2. Build a CNN architecture with Conv + Pool layers
3. Train using backpropagation and cross-entropy loss
4. Evaluate with accuracy and confusion matrix
5. Visualize training & validation curves

### 🔍 Key Results
- CNN extracts spatial features automatically
- Data augmentation improves generalization
- Overfitting controlled using dropout & regularization

### 🛠 Tech Stack
Python, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV

### ▶ How to Run
```
Run all cells in order — training takes time depending on hardware.
```
