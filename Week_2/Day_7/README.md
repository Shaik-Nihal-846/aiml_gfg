## 🎯 Object Detection with YOLO

Deep learning model using **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** for real-time object detection.

### 🎯 Objective
Detect and localize objects in images with high speed and precision.

### 📌 Workflow
1. Prepare dataset with bounding box annotations
2. Train YOLO model / use pretrained weights for fine-tuning
3. Run detection on test images & draw bounding boxes
4. Measure mAP (mean Average Precision)

### 🔍 Learnings
- YOLO achieves real-time inference with high spatial accuracy
- Dataset quality and annotation accuracy greatly affect results

### 🛠 Tech Stack
Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow/PyTorch, YOLOv5/YOLOv8

### ▶ How to Run
```
Run inference cell — output images will display detected objects.
```
