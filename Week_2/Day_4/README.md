## 💬 Text Sentiment Analysis using NLP

A Natural Language Processing model that classifies the sentiment of text into positive/negative/neutral.

### 🎯 Objective
Understand user opinions using machine learning applied to text.

### 📌 Workflow
1. Text cleaning (stopwords, stemming/lemmatization)
2. Tokenization & embedding (TF-IDF / Word2Vec)
3. Train ML/DL models (Naive Bayes / LSTM)
4. Evaluate using confusion matrix and F1-Score

### 🔍 Insights
- Bigram features boost classical ML classifier accuracy
- LSTM captures context better than bag-of-words

### 🛠 Tech Stack
Python, NLTK / SpaCy, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow/Keras

### ▶ How to Run
```
Run cells in order — the final output shows predicted sentiment labels.
