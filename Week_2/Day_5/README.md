## 📈 Sales Forecasting with LSTM

Time-series forecasting using **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural networks.

### 🎯 Objective
Predict future sales by learning long-term patterns from historical data.

### 📌 Workflow
1. Convert sales data into supervised learning format
2. Normalize series + create look-back sequences
3. Train LSTM model and tune hyperparameters
4. Plot training/validation loss curves
5. Compare actual vs predicted values

### 🔍 Key Takeaways
- LSTM captures long-term and seasonal dependencies in sequential data
- Performance increases with correct window size and feature scaling

### 🛠 Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib

### ▶ How to Run
```
Train + evaluate using GPU if available for faster runtime.
