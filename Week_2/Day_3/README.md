## 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

Machine learning classification model to detect fraudulent transactions from anonymized financial features.

### 🎯 Objective
Minimize **false negatives** to ensure fraudulent transactions are correctly detected.

### 📌 Workflow
1. Handle dataset imbalance using SMOTE / undersampling
2. Train models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
3. Evaluate using Precision, Recall, F1-Score & ROC-AUC
4. Inspect most impactful features

### 🔍 Key Learnings
- Recall is prioritized over high overall accuracy
- Class imbalance treatment drastically improves model performance

### 🛠 Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib

### ▶ How to Run
```
Run all cells — confusion matrix & ROC curve appear at the end.
